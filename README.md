# VolatileIDsystem
This is an ID system for users to put certain bits of information in for it to be then written to a file (It was for the most part made as a test for my current Python ability) 

Features
Giving the program information such as name (open to all names), location (open to all locations), Birthdays + sex (is checked), and current occupation (open to all professions)
The program assigns this info a unique ID (a number between 1 and 1000 to access the data). It can then be written onto a file with the unique ID being able to be used to access it (optional to the user)
A system that allows the user to modify the information (which will apply the date of the most recent modification along with its creation date in the profile)
