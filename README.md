# VolatileIDsystem
This is an ID system for users to put certain bits of information in (yet another example of my ability to write scripts in python). It shows gradual improvements from the password checker project 

Improvements from the password checker
  Maintaining a case for the variables so they are easier to read (snake_case)
  More security/stability in the programming so that faulty inputs can be washed out E.g check_sex
  More libraries being used E.g re or OS
  Use of string formatting (when formatting the birthday input)
  Use of dictionaries
  Being a little more user friendly by giving them the option to leave some functions (when asked for their unique ID     
  they instead type 1001, it will take them back to the menu)
